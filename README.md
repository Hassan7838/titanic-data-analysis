"Expolatory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset"

This project performs "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" on the famous "Titanic dataset" to uncover insights about passenger survival based on factors such as age, gender, class, and fare.  

It was completed as part of my "Machine Learning internship", where I explored data preprocessing and visualization techniques using Python.

# Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Loading and exploring the dataset using "Pandas"
- Checking data types, summary statistics, and missing values
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships with "Matplotlib" and "Seaborn"
- Creating:
  - Bar plots for categorical variables  
  - Histograms for numerical variables  
  - Correlation heatmap for numerical features

# Dataset Information

- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)  
- The dataset is **not uploaded** due to size constraints.  
- You can download it directly from Kaggle and place it in your working directory.

# Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
